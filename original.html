  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>I am currently finishing up my final semester as a CS undergraduate at Brigham Young University.  I have focused my studies
    on software testing, verification and validation.  I have accepted an offer to work at Lucid Software in South Jordan Utah
    and will begin after graduation.
    <br>
    My wife and I have been married for 5 years, and we have a two year old daughter.  Outside of lots of coding, they are my life :).
    I enjoy many outdoor activities including running, hiking, and rock climbing.
    <br>
    This line is the change I made in activity D7.

  <h2>Projects:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SHA Algorithm Verification.</strong>  As part of Dr. Mercer's lab here at BYU, I have participated in several
    projects proving out functional equivalence of OpenSSL's SHA implementations to the NIST standards.  We have done this for 
    portions of the SHA2-256 and SHA3-256 algorithms.  Our work on the SHA2 algorithm was accepted to the Nasa Formal Methods conference
    for 2021, and our SHA3 work is currently in review for the Nasa Formal Methods 2022 conference.</li>
    <li><strong>Conway's Game of Life.</strong>  This is a small project I did over christmas break.  I created a GUI application (using
    tkinter in python) that runs conways game of life, and allows for user interaction in selecting cells, and changing the refresh speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Finite State Machine Emulator.</strong>  This is an ongoing project.   I have been working on writing a simple scripting
    language to define finite state machines, and a program that can interpret the script, build a model of the machine, and run test inputs
    through that model.  It is currently in development, but I have it working properly for deterministic instances.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Experience:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Undergraduate Research Assistant (2020-current).</strong>  As mentioned above, I have been working in Dr. Mercer's lab.
    My work is described in the project section.</li>
    <li><strong>CS 142 TA (Spring 2020).</strong>  Worked as a TA for the CS 142 class in spring semester 2020.  Helped student learn
    C++ syntax and debug their code.</li>
    <li><strong>CS 236 TA (Fall 2020).</strong>Worked as a TA for CS 236.  This included helping students learn several topics including graph
    theory, finite machine theory, proof structures.  Also helped debug code in their projects (C++)</li>
    <li><strong>CS 329 TA (Spring 2021, Fall 2021).</strong>Worked as a TA for CS 329.  This included helping students learn testing and static analysis
    principles, as well as simple verification principles.  Also helped debug projects that performed static analysis on Java code.</li>
